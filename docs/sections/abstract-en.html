<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
Manufacturers and users want to monitore their cyber physical systems. In the Industry 4.0 this is done by observing data from sensors. The problem arises when looking at a system of systems, e.g. a production plant or a whole powertrain of a vessel. Multiple systems describe their data in multiple ways and create the problem of analysing these data together in one system. To tackle this problem and to make transferability of algorithms (ML methods) between different monitoring systems possible, the CPSWatch Ontology is defined to create a top level description of a CPS system. </span>
